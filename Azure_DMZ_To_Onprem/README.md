## Introduction
This reference architecture shows a secure hybrid network that extends an on-premises network to Azure. The architecture implements a DMZ, also called a perimeter network, between the on-premises network and an Azure virtual network (VNet). The DMZ includes network virtual appliances (NVAs) that implement security functionality such as firewalls and packet inspection.

This solution uses an Terraform template to launch a two NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Standby) in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows from an ALB to the BIG-IP VE which then processes the traffic to application servers. This is the standard cloud design where the BIG-IP VE instance is running with a dual interface, where both management and data plane traffic is processed on each one.  

The BIG-IP VEs have the [Local Traffic Manager (LTM)](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality. This means you can also configure the BIG-IP VE to enable F5's L4/L7 security features, access control, and intelligent traffic management.

**Networking Stack Type:** This solution deploys into a new networking stack, which is created along with the solution.

## Prerequisites
- On-premises network. A private local-area network implemented in an organization.
- Gateway. The gateway provides connectivity between the routers in the on-premises network and the VNet.
- User defined routes (UDR). User defined routes define the flow of IP traffic within Azure VNets
- **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See [K2873](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873) for details.
- This template requires a service principal.  See the [Service Principal Setup section](#service-principal-authentication) for details, including required permissions.
- This deployment will be using the Terraform Azurerm provider to build out all the neccessary Azure objects. Therefore, Azure CLI is required. for installation, please follow this [Microsoft link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt?view=azure-cli-latest)
- If this is the first time to deploy the F5 image, the subscription used in this deployment needs to be enabled to programatically deploy. For more information, please refer to [Configure Programatic Deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/working-with-marketplace-images-on-azure-resource-manager/)

## Important configuration notes

- All variables are configured in variables.tf 
- Azure Subscription and Service Principal are configured in provider.tf
- This template would require Declarative Onboarding and AS3 packages for the initial configuration. As part of the onboarding script, it will download the RPMs respectively. So please see the [AS3 documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3.5.1/) and [DO documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/prereqs.html) for details on how to use AS3 and Declarative Onboarding on your BIG-IP VE(s).
- onboard.tpl is the onboarding script, which is run by commandToExecute, and it will be copy to /var/lib/waagent/CustomData upon bootup. This script is basically responsible for downloading the neccessary DO and AS3 RPM files, installing them, and then executing the onboarding REST calls.
- This template uses PayGo BIGIP image for the deployment (as default). If you would like to use BYOL, then these following steps are needed:
1. In the "variable.tf", specify the BYOL image and licenses regkeys.
2. In the "main.tf", uncomment the "local_sku" lines.
3. Add the following lines to the "cluster.json" file just under the "Common" declaration:
  ```
          "myLicense": {
            "class": "License",
            "licenseType": "regKey",
            "regKey": "${local_sku}"
          },
  ```
- In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template, you must create virtual server(s) on the BIG-IP VE.  See [Creating a virtual server](#creating-virtual-servers-on-the-big-ip-ve).
- See the **[Configuration Example](#configuration-example)** section for a configuration diagram and description for this solution.

## Creating virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE

In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers through the BIG-IP system, you must create a virtual server on the BIG-IP VE.

In this template, the Azure public IP address is associated with an Azure Load Balancer that forwards traffic to a backend pool that includes the primary (self) IP configurations for *each* BIG-IP network interface.  Because traffic is destined for the self IP addresses of the BIG-IP VEs, you must create a single virtual server with a wildcard destination in Traffic Group **None**.

1. Once your BIG-IP VE has launched, open the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.
2. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and then click the **Create** button.
3. In the **Name** field, give the Virtual Server a unique name.
4. In the **Destination/Mask** field, type the destination address ( for example: 0.0.0.0/0).
5. In the **Service Port** field, type the appropriate port.
6. Configure the rest of the virtual server as appropriate.
7. If you used the Service Discovery iApp template: In the Resources section, from the **Default Pool** list, select the name of the pool created by the iApp.
8. Click the **Finished** button.
9. Repeat as necessary.

When you have completed the virtual server configuration, you must modify the virtual addresses to use Traffic Group None using the following guidance.

1. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers**.
2. On the Menu bar, click the **Virtual Address List** tab.
3. Click the address of one of the virtual servers you just created.
4. From the **Traffic Group** list, select **None**.
5. Click **Update**.
6. Repeat for each virtual server.
